## Problem 3: Messy React

### Solution

The Messy React problem is solved using React.js. The provided code presented several inefficiencies and anti-patterns, which have been addressed and optimized:

#### Code Improvements and Optimizations

Here are some issues and improvements in the provided code:

1. **Missing Imports**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly imported or provided.

2. **Incomplete `BoxProps` Import**: The import of `BoxProps` is incomplete, and it's not clear where it should come from.

3. **Type Safety for `useState`**: While the `useState` hook for `prices` is well-typed with `{ [currency: string]: number } | null`, it's good practice to provide default values or handle the null case more explicitly.

4. **Lack of Error Handling in `Datasource.getPrices`**: While the `Datasource.getPrices` function handles fetch errors with a `try...catch` block, it would be beneficial to provide more informative error messages or log details about the failed request.

5. **Simplified Sorting and Filtering**: The sorting and filtering of `balances` have been simplified, which may not accurately reflect the intended behavior.

6. **Inconsistent Naming**: The variable names like `lhs` and `rhs` are used in the sorting function but are not very descriptive. Consider using more meaningful variable names to improve code readability.

7. **Missing Token Price Validation**: The code assumes that token prices will always be available for every token, which might not be the case. It should handle cases where prices are missing more gracefully.

8. **Missing Component Details**: The code references `WalletRow`, but the code for this component is not included in the provided snippet. Ensure that `WalletRow` is correctly implemented and imported.

9. **No Handling for Form Submission**: While the code sets up a form and fetches prices, there's no handling for what should happen when the user submits the form. You need to implement form submission logic based on your application's requirements.

10. **Code Organization**: Consider breaking down the code into smaller, more focused functions or components to improve code readability and maintainability.
