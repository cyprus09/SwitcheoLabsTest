Differences:

Usage of useEffect:

In the original version, a class named Datasource is used to fetch data from a URL.
In the updated version, the fetch API is used directly inside the useEffect hook for data fetching.
Handling Prices:

In the original version, the prices fetched are stored in the prices state as an empty object (i.e., {}).
In the updated version, the prices state is defined with a more specific type, which is an object with currency keys and number values. It's initially set as null.
Sorting of Balances:

In the original version, the sorting of balances uses lhsPriority and has a condition related to a non-existing lhsPriority.
In the updated version, the sorting of balances uses getPriority directly and ensures that only positive balances are included in the sorted array.
Condition for Sorting:

In the original version, the sorting condition is based on leftPriority > rightPriority and rightPriority > leftPriority.
In the updated version, the sorting condition is simplified to rightPriority - leftPriority. This results in reverse sorting based on the priority values.
prices Usage:

In the original version, the USD price (usdPrice) is used directly without handling the case where the currency price might be missing from the prices object.
In the updated version, the usdPrice is safely accessed with the ?. (optional chaining) operator, and a default value of 0 is provided in case the currency price is missing.
Console Error Spelling:

In the original version, the console error is misspelled as console.err. It should be console.error.
In the updated version, the spelling is corrected as console.error.
Type Annotations:

The updated version provides more specific type annotations, especially for the prices state, making the code more type-safe.
Imports:

Both versions assume an import for WalletRow, but the updated version mentions this explicitly. However, it's not clear where BoxProps is imported from in either version.

Logic Refinements:

The updated version refines the logic to be more concise and easier to read.
