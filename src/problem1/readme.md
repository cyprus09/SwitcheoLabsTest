## Problem 1: Three Ways to Sum to N

### Solution

- Three JavaScript functions (`sum_to_n_a`, `sum_to_n_b`, and `sum_to_n_c`) are provided in the code.
-    1. **Method - 1: Using a Loop**
        - Time Complexity: O(n)
        - Space Complexity: O(1)
        - Implementation: This solution uses a loop to iterate from 1 to `n` and adds all the integers in the range.
     2. **Method - 2: Using AP Formula for n Consecutive Integers**
        - Time Complexity: O(1)
        - Space Complexity: O(1)
        - Implementation: This solution applies the arithmetic progression (AP) formula for the sum of n consecutive integers to calculate the sum.
     3. **Method - 3: Recursive Approach**
        - Time Complexity: O(n)
        - Space Complexity: O(n)
        - Implementation: This solution uses a recursive approach to calculate the sum by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
   - Each function is documented for clarity.
